Current State: Overview and Summary

SCL Corporation is a global technology company with its headquarters located in San Francisco, California. SCL is known for its cutting-edge software products and services used by millions of customers worldwide. The company's main campus in San Francisco houses approximately 5,000 employees working in various departments and teams.

At SCL Corporation, employees often need to collaborate across different teams and attend numerous meetings throughout the day. As a result, they frequently visit the company's multiple on-campus cafeterias to grab a quick meal or coffee to keep up with their busy schedules.

Management has observed that employees spend a significant portion of their breaks waiting in line at the cafeterias, which can be time-consuming and frustrating. On average, employees spend around 20-30 minutes in line to order their food, leading to shorter actual break times.

Furthermore, the cafeterias often run out of popular food items or specialty coffees, leaving employees disappointed and searching for alternative options. This can result in a less-than-optimal dining experience and wasted time as employees search for other dining options off-campus.

In response to these challenges, many employees have expressed a strong interest in a mobile app or web platform online ordering system that would allow them to pre-order their meals or beverages from the company's cafeterias. The system would enable them to specify pickup times, ensuring that their food or coffee is ready when they arrive, saving time and reducing waiting periods during breaks.

Cost Savings: SCL Corporation will benefit from cost reductions associated with decreased food wastage and improved cafeteria efficiency.

Enhanced Employee Satisfaction: Implementing the Canteen Ordering System will demonstrate the company's commitment to employee convenience, boosting overall employee satisfaction and morale.

**As the Business Analyst, my role would involve gathering detailed requirements and specifications to develop an efficient and user-friendly Canteen Ordering System that aligns with these advantages and meets the specific needs of SCL Corporation. **

#Environments:
We have chosen Python as the programming language for developing and maintaining the system. Python offers flexibility and ease of development, making it an ideal choice for adapting to changing requirements. With proper design and development, the system should require minimal ongoing maintenance.

Business Objective 1 (SCL Objective 1):
Reduce Canteen Food Wastage: Decrease canteen food wastage by a minimum of 25% within 6 months following the initial release.
Scale Measurement: Evaluate the value of food discarded each month by monitoring canteen inventory. Previous wastage rate: 20%
Must Achieve: Target less than 20% wastage.

Business Objective 2 (SCL Objective 2):
Reduce Canteen Operating Costs: Achieve a 15% reduction in canteen operating costs within 12 months following the initial release.

Business Objective 3 (SCL Objective 3):
Increase Employee Productivity: Raise the average effective work time by 30 minutes per employee per day within 3 months.

Business Objective 4 (SCL Objective 4):
Operational Efficiency: Optimize canteen operations by automating the ordering process and implementing food delivery to user workstations, reducing the need for additional manpower.

Future State of the Canteen Ordering System:

User-Friendly Menu Display:
Employees will access the Canteen Ordering System's webpage to view an updated daily menu. The menu will feature a comprehensive list of available dishes in the canteen, complete with prices.

Order Placement Deadline:
Lunch orders can be placed by employees until 12 PM. After 12 pm, the system will no longer accept lunch orders to ensure chefs have adequate time for meal preparation. A Menu Manager (a canteen staff member) will be responsible for creating and updating the menu.

Flexible Order Selection:
Users can easily select the lunch dishes they wish to order and create their personalized meal orders. They will have the flexibility to edit their selections before proceeding to checkout.

Order Confirmation Lock:
Once an order is confirmed and checked out, users will not have the option to cancel or modify their order.

Order Management by Canteen Manager:
The Canteen Manager, also known as the Order Processor, will have access to view all orders placed by employees. The manager will compile an inventory of dishes ordered by different users and coordinate meal preparation with the chef.

Efficient Workstation Delivery:
The Canteen Manager will be able to request meal deliveries to employees' workstations.

Dedicated Delivery Personnel:
A dedicated delivery personnel, referred to as the "delivery boy," will handle meal deliveries to employees' desks. After successful delivery, the delivery personnel will close the online customer order.

Feedback Mechanism:
Users dissatisfied with any aspect of the food items or delivery process will have the option to submit feedback for improvement.

Salary Deduction Payment System:
The system will not require a separate payment gateway. Instead, payment for ordered dishes will be deducted directly from employees' salaries. Employees will need to enroll in the salary payment deduction program, which the payroll system will manage.

Monthly Payroll Calculation:
At the end of each month, the payroll system will calculate the total number of dishes ordered by each employee and deduct the corresponding amount from their salary.
